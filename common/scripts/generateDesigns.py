# Description: Python script to create unique designs from a template and combinations of knobs.

# README
##############
# This function copies the folder given by 'dirToCopy' into multiple design folders.
# Then it opens and parses the given template knob file to generate proper knobs.
# Then it parses the given kernel file, replaces the "#include" line by the generated knobs,
# and writes the result into the design folders.
#
# The directory to copy should contain links to the host code and the Makefile.
# The directory to copy MUST NOT contain links to the kernel file.
